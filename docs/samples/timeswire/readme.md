# TimesWire Search

> see https://aka.ms/autorest

This is the AutoRest configuration and documentation file for TimesWire Search.

---
## Getting Started
To build the SDK for TimesWire Search, you will need the following: 

- An [API KEY](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) for the times wire service

- Some files, which you can get with the following script:

``` powershell
mkdir -ea 0 ./generated/custom  
mkdir -ea 0 ./generated/test  

iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/autorest.powershell/main/samples/TimesWire/readme.md -outfile ./readme.md
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/autorest.powershell/main/samples/TimesWire/timeswire.yaml -outfile ./timeswire.yaml
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/autorest.powershell/main/samples/TimesWire/generated/private/custom/Module.cs -outfile ./generated/custom/Module.cs
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/autorest.powershell/main/samples/TimesWire/generated/tests/get-article.tests.ps1 -outfile ./generated/test/get-article.tests.ps1

```

Then simply [Install AutoRest](../../readme.md#installing) and in this folder, run:

> `autorest`

Then you can compile the module:

> `./generated/build-module.ps1`

``` text
Spawning in isolated process.
Cleaning folders...
Compiling private module code
Private Module loaded (C:\...\sample\generated\bin\TimesNewswire.private.dll).
Processing cmdlet variants
Generating unified cmdlet proxies
Done.
```

But really, you want to build the module and then load it in a new instance of `pwsh`, so add `-Run`:

> `./generated/build-module.ps1 -Run`

``` text
Spawning in isolated process.
Cleaning folders...
Compiling private module code
Private Module loaded (C:\...\sample\generated\bin\TimesNewswire.private.dll).

PS C:\...\sample\generated [ testing TimesNewswire ] >
```

Set your Api Key 

> `$env:TimesApiKey="#################"

and run the cmdlet: 

> `(Get-Article -Source nyt -Section sports).Results | fl * `

``` bash

## Notes about using Authentication
AutoRest doesn't add authentication code into the generated client, given that there is so much variance on how that works.

This sample includes an [extension](./generated/custom/Module.cs) to the module that alters the HTTP payload before it's sent.


### AutoRest Configuration  Information
These are the settings for generating the cmdlets for the API with AutoRest (instead of putting them on the command line)

``` yaml
input-file: timeswire.yaml
namespace: Times.Wire.Search

powershell:
  clear-output-folder: true
  output-folder: generated

  operations:
    Articles_ListBySourceAndRange:
      verb: Get
      noun: MyArticle
      description: Gets an article for me.
      parameters:
        TimePeriod:
          type: integer
          description: The *time* period. Get it ? "TIME"
        Source: null # delete this parameter entirely.
```

# PowerShell
This configuration block pulls in the powershell generator automatically. 

``` yaml
use:
- "@autorest/powershell"

```
