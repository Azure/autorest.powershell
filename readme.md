# NOTES
This file is really only used for local testing, where loading the individual plugins on the cmdline is terribly
cumbersome.

### Autorest plugin configuration
- Please don't edit this section unless you're re-configuring how the powershell extension plugs in to AutoRest
AutoRest needs the below config to pick this up as a plug-in - see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/master/docs/developer/architecture/AutoRest-extension.md

``` yaml 
pipeline-model: v3
powershell: true
require: "$(this-folder)/powershell/readme.md"
```
